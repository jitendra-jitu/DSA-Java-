## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jitendra-jitu/DSA-Java-Python.git
cd DSA-Java-Python
```


##Prerequisites
---------------

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
Python 3.x
An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code for Java; PyCharm, VS Code for Python)


##Data Structures
------------------

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures in both Java and Python:
Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Hash Tables
Trees
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees
AVL Trees
Graphs

You can find the implementation of each data structure in their respective folders, labeled as java/ and python/.

#Algorithms
-----------

This repository includes implementations of various algorithms, categorized as follows:

```
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
Graph Algorithms
Depth First Search (DFS)
Breadth First Search (BFS)
Dynamic Programming
```

Each algorithm is implemented in both Java and Python with explanations and comments for better understanding.

##Usage
-------


#Java

To use any of the Java implementations, simply navigate to the corresponding folder and run the Java files. For example, to run the Merge Sort implementation, navigate to the java/sorting folder and run:

bash
Copy code
cd java/sorting
```
javac MergeSort.java
java MergeSort
```
#Python

To use any of the Python implementations, navigate to the corresponding folder and run the Python files. For example, to run the Merge Sort implementation, navigate to the python/sorting folder and run:

bash
Copy code
```
cd python/sorting
python merge_sort.py
```
Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to suit your learning needs.
